  title="About Imbue Office Space"
  content="Imbue is a 20,000 ft building that hosts a number of office spaces for businesses looking to work in a spacious and modern environment. Striving to inspire its tenants, Imbue encourages them to thrive. 

  Located in Spectrum Business Park in the County Durham town of Seaham, Imbue is a mere 2.5 miles away from Dalton Park Outlet Shopping and Leisure Centre and just over 1 mile away from Seaham town centre. 
  With easy access to both A19 and A1, the northeast hubs of Sunderland, Newcastle and Durham are a short drive away, each one jam-packed with fantastic places to eat, drink, shop and be entertained!
  
  As well as stunning views, Imbue also holds a breath-taking full height atrium reception area and a ‘meet and greet’ receptionist. From there, tenants can access all floors via two separate lifts.
